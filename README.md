## (was: Firefox Accounts Feature Planning)

This was a small meta-repo in which we did feature planning
for Firefox Accounts.  It's being kept alive for now in order
to preserve the history of issue cards and comments, but is
no longer in active use.  Feature planning for FxA is now
done via the "Projects" tool:
